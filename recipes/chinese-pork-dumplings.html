        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Seattle's International District, Liana Cafe House sells traditional Chinese pork dumplings from a tiny takeout shop. See how to make them at home. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> ½ cup soy sauce </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon sesame seeds </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®) </li>
            <li> 1 pound ground pork </li>
            <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 egg, beaten </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
            <li> 1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger </li>
            <li> 50 dumpling wrappers </li>
            <li> 1 cup vegetable oil for frying </li>
            <li> 1 quart water, or more as needed </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix pork, garlic, egg, 2 tablespoons chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat with remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water, cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Serve with soy sauce mixture for dipping.</li>
